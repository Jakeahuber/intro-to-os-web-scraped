## Intro to Operating Systems: Web Scraped 

This program builds a pdf document that contains the most important concepts/ideas of an introduction to OS course. 
It does this by web scraping the "Operating System" wikipedia page and pursues every linked term or phrase in a paragraph of text. It then takes the first paragraph of the linked page and appends that text to a pdf document.
