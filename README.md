## Intro to Operating Systems: Electric Boogaloo 

This program builds a pdf document that offers a rough implementation of an introduction to OS course. It does this by taking the wikipedia page for "Operating System" and pursues every linked term or phrase in a paragraph of text. It then takes the first paragraph of the linked page and appends that text to a pdf document.
